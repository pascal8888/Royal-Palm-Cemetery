Notes:  Royal Palm Cemetery is located at 101 - 55th Street S., St. 
Petersburg, Florida. Reginald H. Sumner established Royal Palm in 1921 
after purchasing 80 acres of land between Fifty-fifth and Forty-eighth 
streets and First and Ninth avenues south from Mr. George S. Gandy. A 
palm lined road leads to the cemetery offices in the middle of the tract. 
This building had once served as a chapel. Of the original parcel, 55 acres 
remain as cemetery today. There is more than a mile of winding roads that 
section off the cemetery.  

The Pinellas Genealogy Society volunteer canvassers began canvassing Royal 
Palm on October 14, 2000, completing the project on March 10, 2001. The following 
individuals participated in the survey of Royal Palm Cemetery: Trish Burch, 
Lesleigh Butts (Project Chair), Ann Cantlin, Charlie & Pat Grandmaison, Pat 
Johnston, Kerry and JoAnn McElhaney, Rae Rose and Beth Shields. The following 
individuals assisted with foreign language translation: Mrs. Alice Groman (Russian), 
Mr. Stanley Shalit (Jewish), Mrs. Nancy Keizer (Dutch). The survey resulted in 
22,069 recorded interments. Although every attempt was made to record every burial, 
the data will not reflect those buried without headstones or headstones that have 
gone below ground. PGS member Joseph C. Grandmaison completed the bulk of data 
entry on this project, his wife Pat assisting with the verification process.   
Boy Scout, Kyle Cannon, of Scout Troop 84 - West Central Florida Council supervised 
a team of volunteers who worked on finishing the final twenty five percent of this 
project to earn Kyle the rank of Eagle Scout. His team of volunteers were:  Boyd & 
Cheryl Belnap, Bruce & Phyllis Belnap, Jean Boyer, Earl Brigance, Kari & Jordan Cannon, 
Jeffrey & Kevin Cluff, Don Conrad, Larry & Diana Dean, Gene & Margie Fallon, Diane 
Griffin, Phil & Virginia Huchton, Barbara Knibbs Peter Luginbuehl, Bob McManaway, Bob 
Smith, Cesar Tolentino, Todd Williams.
